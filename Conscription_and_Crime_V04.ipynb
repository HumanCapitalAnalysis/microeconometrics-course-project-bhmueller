    "The novelty of the study by Galiani et al. is that they not only estimate the effects of conspcription in wartime but also in peacetime.

    "1. The effect of serving in the military may be quite different when exposed to actual combat. Those individuals envolved in combat may suffer from detrimental effects on their mental and physical health. These conditions may have a large impact on their subsequent criminal behaviour after serving in the military and may also lessen labour market outcomes.\n",

The varible *malvinas* (Spanish name of the Falkland Islands) is a dummy which returns *1* if indidviduals of the cohort *c* served during the *Falklands War* in 1982 (for the main analysis only cohort 1962 served during the war)."

    "In the following, potential issues concerning the identification of the causal relationship and its crucial assumptions are discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Galina et al. want to study the effect of serving in the military on subsequent criminal behaviour. They want to estimate the following regression (p. 127). Note that the notation presented here does not coincide with the one presented in the article. I adopted the notation used by Winship and Morgan (2014): $$Y_{ci} = \\alpha + \\delta D_{ci} + \\gamma_{c} + \\epsilon_{ci}$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $Y_{ci}$ denotes *crime rate*,\n",
    "- $D$, denotes *conscription*,\n",
    "- $\\delta$, is the ATE,\n",
    "- $\\gamma_{c}$, a cohort effect, and\n",
    "- $\\epsilon_{ci}$, an error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally this amounts to  the following:\n",
    "$$E[Y_{ci}] = E[\\alpha + \\delta D_{ci} + \\gamma_{c} + \\epsilon_{ci}] = \\alpha + \\delta E[D] + E[\\epsilon_{ci}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After some manipulation we arrive at\n",
    "$$E[]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the assumption $E[\\epsilon∣D]=0$ holds, we can successfully identify the causal effect of $D$ on $Y$ as the average treatment effect.\n",
    "But, in the above described setting (see causal graph) it is possible that being actually drafted into the military is subject to some form of selection. Recall that all individuals in birth cohort *c* needed to attend medical examinations.\n",
    "Failing the medical examination could be correlated with the socioeconomic background one has. There are various studies suggesting that health and socioeconomic status are associated (cite!). On the other hand, individuals with a high draft number, i.e. with a high probability of being drafted into the military, fail the medical examinations by purpose and are not being drafted into the military. One could imagine that well-placed individuals are more able to do so than individuals from other socioeconomic backgrounds. This renders *conscription* endogeneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we cannot ensure that in equation (get no.!) $$E[\\epsilon∣D]=0$$\n",
    "This endogeneity issue can be partially overcome by using an IV approach. A valid instrument needs to necessarily fulfil the following two conditions (this specification applies for the case of a binary instrument):\n",
    "1. Exogeneity: $E[\\epsilon∣Z]=0$\n",
    "2. Relevance: $E[Z∣D]\\neq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "After some manipulation we arrive at the Wald estimator\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\delta}_{IV, Wald} = \\frac{E[Y|Z=1]-E[Y∣Z=0]}{E[D|Z=1]-E[D|Z=0]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The exogeneity condition cannot be tested statistically. One can only argue whether an instrument is uncorrelated to the error $\\epsilon$. Condition 2 can be tested by means of estimating the effect from the instrument to the endogenous independent variable $D$. The effect needs to be large and statistically significant. Otherwise we would end up with a weak instrument, which would render the IV estimator useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, I employ the Potential Outcome framework as presented in Winship and Morgan (2014, p.xxy) in order to clarify the empirical stragtegy the paper is based upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Outcome framework & LATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the light of essential individual heterogeneity though, the IV results cannot be interpreted as an ATE, i.e. $\\delta$ is not constant in the population. This is the case, since we can only make statements about the causal relationship of individuals whose probability of treatment changes according to the IV. In the empirical investigation at hand this means that the estimated effect is the effect on the compliers only, i.e. the individuals who join the military because they are coerced of doing so by having a draft number higher than the cutoff. That is, the Wald estimator in this context converges in probabilty to $E[\\delta |C=c]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on condition of monotonicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This treatment affect is denoted the *Local Average Tretament Effect* (LATE), introduced by Angrist et al. (1996). The additional condition of monotonicity implies that there are either compliers or defiers in the treatment group. In the problem at hand this amounts to assuming that there are no draft-lottery defiers in the sample. A draft-lottery defier is a person that would have served voluntarily, i.e. if he wasn't assigned a draft number above the cutoff, but abstains from military service if he got a draft number above the cutoff. To avoid military service, if one was assigned a number above the cutoff, it is necessary to fail the medical examination, what might come with some effort. Thus, one can argue that there are no defiers in the sample, i.e. people who had served if service was voluntary, but who did not if they were drafted.\n",
    "Moreover, the treatment effect of the analysis is only provided for the draft-lottery compliers, since, given monotonicity, only these are the ones having an impact on the estimates of the effect on crime rates.\n",
    "Thus, $\\delta$ is not constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy relevance of the instrument. We are fine, since we also test the draft lottery as a policy.\n",
    "See Heckman (1997). The effect the paper by Galinai et al. (2011) wants to evaluate is in fact the effect of compulsory military service on crime rates, not the average treatment effect of serving in the military per se. The precise question they ask is whether conscription should be implemented in order to lower crime rates. The effect they find is the effect on individuals that were induced to serve due to the draft lottery."

The draft numbers were assigned on May 27, 1994, but on August 31, 1994 conscription was abolished (ibid, p. 131). The authors employ the cutoff number of the cohort of 1975 and find no effect on crime rates. They argue that this ruled out all concerns that the instrument has an independent effect on crime rates (see section 1 for a discussion of potential pitfalls). Garano (2010) states that conscription was abolished because of a murder on a soldier on May 6, 1994 (p. 174). Therefore I do not find their argumentation based on the usage of the cohort of 1976 convincing and their instrument may be compromised. I extend their analysis by using a range of cutoff numbers."

    " - Same criticism to Angrist (1990) by Rosenzweig & Wolpin (2000) applicable to this study if mechanism thorugh labour market\n",
    " - Positive: they consider a deeper mechanism of conscription on crimerate. But they still go not deep enough.\n",
    " - Effect of 'navy': what if navy has otherwise detrimental effects that lead to crime rate to incr.?\n",
    " - Problems of intention-to-treat estimates\n",
    "  - read sth up for this\n",
    "  - check rsults: which crimes are committed more often? Is this in line with other research? Plausibility of the results.\n",
    " - Defiers: Authors do not argue why defiers are improbable; this is an assumption, nothing else.\n",
    " - Authors state that white collar and crimes against property should be larger if conscription detrimental effect on lM outcomes (p. 133). But same should apply to drug trafficking, since it also serves a pecuniary purpose, I'd argue.\n",
    " - Effect of navy: maybe other detrimental effects of serving in the navy. Implicit assump.: navy service same as air force and army on crime rates except for duration!"
